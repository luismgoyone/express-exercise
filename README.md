1. [HTTP Response Code for Resource Already Exists](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3825990/http-response-code-for-post-when-resource-already-exists) - it's funny how the response codes are not really very strictly followed, or maybe it's really a living standard that you will see the cracks in its surface hehe.

2. Is there some package that does something like when we used `graphql-tag`?: 
```ts
  psql`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        first_name VARCHAR(20),
        last_name VARCHAR(20)
      );`
```

3. When I started this, I realize, i need the MVC paradigm. Even if I'm not 100% wanting to use rails, I appreciated the workflow of creating models, and just cli-ing to create migrations. I am returning to my working knowledge of MERN, by returning, going back to learning it, I haven't used it in production! Is there a good MVC framework for express? My code is about to be spaghetti. 

4. Being a tech lead is hard. It might not be for every one. Hell, I feel it's not really for me. Because I missed this intensity of just thinking about code, and as I continue this exercise, it feels like I got back home. I mean, you will always realize that to be able to think better as a lead, you need to actually implement all the little details. This is yet again a humbling experience for me because even if I know I don't know everything, I am forgetting some things! So my stand now, to be a tech lead should be not to eliminate coding but to always be vigilant in terms of opportunities to delegate. Like a true king that starts riding at the front of his army towards the enemy.

5. I think we should standardize anything about api - the contract of BE and FE early on. And utilize response codes instead of returning boolean success. 

### For API Standardization
1. Use of more meaningful response status codes
2. Try to create a standard shape for response object:

```
{
  "success": Boolean // we might not need this if we utilize response status codes! Response.ok can be utilized too
  "data": Array or Object
  "message": programmatical error made by devs
  "error": system generated error message
}
```
3. Error Codes - (enum types)
4. Message - can be non enum, for personalized message
5. Review of resource / endpoint url structure
6. [About modelling json api](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14538774)
- JSend opinionated about status as required on message body, i need an example for this:
> The spec is meant to be as small, constrained, and generally-applicable as possible. As such, it has to be somewhat self-contained. A common pattern for implementing JSON services is to load a JavaScript file which passes a JSON block into a user-specified callback. JSON-over-XHR handling in many JavaScript frameworks follows similar patterns. As such, the end-user (developer) never has a chance to access the HTTP response itself.
- JSONAPI needs to be setup.
7. What's more expensive, sql or code manipulation?
8. Better rollback system for developing queries? - BEGIN COMMIT helps.
9. How to organize psql query strings?
10. Research about stored procedures and atomicity. Check standards for PSQL.
11. Endpoint naming
12. Research on SQL Injection and other security stuff
13. Folder structure
14. Explore pgTap or other unit to regresstion testing for pgsql scripts.

## Route Anatomy (Express Implementation)
```ts

router.route(
  ENDPOINT // 1. URL Endpoint Subpath
)
.post( // 2. REST Method
  async( // Usually async due to db operations
    (req, res, next) => {
      const  { headers, body, params } = req // 3. Request Destructuring

      // 4. Response Body Type Checking - explore ORMs for this!
      const isUserLogin = Object.keys(body).length === 2
        && body.username
        && body.password
        
      const isUserRegistration = Object.keys(body).length === 4
        && body.first_name
        && body.last_name
        && body.username
        && body.password

      if (!isUserLogin && !isUserRegistration) { // 5. Client-Side Body Type Guard Clauses - to be able to resolve request that can be resolved due to (4.) without always interacting with the DB.Å¾
        res.status(400).json({

        })

          })
          next();
          return;
        }

      if (!db) { // 6. DB Guard Clause - Check first if db is active as first logic?
        res.status(500).json({
        message: 'Something went wrong!',
        });
        next(); // Always have next() and return calls for each decision point, given that an all-route logic exists to cover 5xx cases
        return;
      }

      try { // 7. Try Block - this encapsulates all logic with DB operations to catch errors!

        if (isUserRegistration) { // Each clause is defined by (4.)
          const registerUserQueryResponse = await db.oneOrNone( // 8. PSQL DB Operation - to try as much as possible to have only one query even for error case

                  WHERE NOT EXISTS (
                    SELECT 1 
                      FROM user_logins 
                        WHERE username = $3

        res.status(500).json({ // Same as DB Guard Clause but this is not Server-Side
          message: 'Something went wrong!',
        })
        next();
        return;
      }
    }
  )
)

```

## Response Blocks Anatomy (Express Implementation)

### Success Case
```ts
 res // 1. Response Object
  .status(201) // 2. HTTP Status Code
  .json({ // 3. JSON Body
    data: registerUserQueryResponse,
  })
  next(); // 4. Express Handling
  return; // Always return
```

### Fail Case
```ts
  const isUsernameExisting = !registerUserQueryResponse // 1. Condition Logic
  if (isUsernameExisting)  { // 2. Condition Block
    res // 3. Response Object
      .status(409) // 4. HTTP Status Code
      .json({ // 5. JSON Body
        message: 'User already exists!'
      })
    next(); // 6. Express Handling
    return; // Always return
  }
```
